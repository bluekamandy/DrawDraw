# DrawDraw

A simple immediate-mode 2d rendering framework. Graphics are raster-based. Object-oriented programming knowledge is not necessary for beginners.

Inspired heavily by my experience with Processing (which is amazing) and designed to enable me to quickly create graphics with imperative code.

This project is really a 2d rendering sandbox for iOS that helps me learn computer graphics algorithms. I'm open to suggestions or collaboration. I'll continue to build it out as I learn more.
